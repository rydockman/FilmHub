# FilmHub
This project was created with the intention of being a database for movies and films where users can browse these films by different search criteria in an interesting and meaningful way to learn more about specific films.

# My Contribution
My contribution to this project was the front-end work using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We did use a website template for a basis to work off of, but everything other than the template is my own code. I also contributed in scraping data including movie titles, images, descriptions, genres, etc.. from IMDB using Python and Selenium.

# Images and Descriptions
